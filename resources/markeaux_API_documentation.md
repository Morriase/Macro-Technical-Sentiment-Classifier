Getting Started
Introduction
Our API is designed to provide global financial and stock market news and analysis to elevate financial apps and identify best performing entities in the news. You are able to generate news feeds based on numerous filters, including entity symbol, type, exchange, industry, country and much more. As well as this, you are able to identify the best or worst performing entities and use this to generate charts.

We support over 5,000 news sources globally in over 30 languages, tracking over 200,000 entities every minute from over 80 markets worldwide.

To get started simply sign up and use your API token in any of the available API endpoints documented below for instant access.

HTTP GET Parameters
name	required	description
api_token	true	Your API token which can be found on your account dashboard.
symbols	false	Specify entity symbol(s) which have been identified within the article. Find entity symbols in our entity search endpoint or see our API overview.
Example: symbols=TSLA,AMZN,MSFT
entity_types	false	Specify the type of entities which have been identified within the article. Find entity types in our entity type metadata endpoint or see our API overview.

Example: countries=us,ca
sentiment_gte	false	Use this to find all articles with entities with a sentiment_score of greater than or equal to x.
Example: sentiment_gte=0 - this will find all articles which are neutral or positive

Sentiment is between -1 and +1. Anything 0 = neutral, above 0 = positive, below 0 = negative. The higher or lower the sentiment score the more positive or negative it is identified as.
sentiment_lte	false	Use this to find all articles with entities with a sentiment_score of less than or equal to x.
Example: sentiment_lte=0 - this will find all articles which are neutral or negative
min_match_score	false	Use this to find all articles with entities with a match_score of geater than or equal to min_match_score.
filter_entities	false	By default all entities for each article are returned - by setting this to true, only the relevant entities to your query will be returned with each article. For example, if you set symbols=TSLA and filter_entities=true, only "TSLA" entities will be returned with the articles.
Default: false
must_have_entities	false	By default all articles are returned, set this to true to ensure that at least one entity has been identified within the article.
Default: false
group_similar	false	Group similar articles to avoid displaying multiple articles on the same topic/subject.

+ signifies AND operation
| signifies OR operation
- negates a single token
" wraps a number of tokens to signify a phrase for searching
* at the end of a term signifies a prefix query
( and ) signify precedence
To use one of these characters literally, escape it with a preceding backslash (\).
This searches the full body of the text and the title.

Example: "ipo" -nyse (searches for articles which must include the string "ipo" but articles must NOT mention NYSE.)

For more advanced query examples, see our API Examples section.

Entity Stats (time series) Available on: Standard and above
Endpoint
GET https://api.marketaux.com/v1/entity/stats/intraday HTTP/1.1
Get an intraday view of how well entities performed over different intervals using this endpoint. Find the best or worst performing entities broken down to every minute, hour, day, week, month, quarter or year. Useful for comparing entities and creating graphs and charts

Adding symbols to the request is not necessary - by default all of the best performing stocks are returned. Filter entities by symbols, exchanges, industries, countries, entity types and more.

HTTP GET Parameters
name	required	description
api_token	true	Your API token which can be found on your account dashboard.
interval	false	The interval of the time series.

Options: minute | hour | day | week | month | quarter | year
Default: day
Example: interval=day

Note: there are restrictions on the maximum time frame for each interval. This is based on the published_before parameter. From the published_before date specified, the maximum time frame that can be retrieved is as following:

minute = 7 days
hour = 1 month
day = 3 years
week = 5 years
month = 5 years
quarter = 10 years
year = 10 years

By default the maximum allowed time frame will be applied. If the time frame is exceeded by the date parameters provided, the default will be applied - no error will be thrown.

For example, if interval=minute and published_before=2021-01-10, the max that can be returned will be back to 2021-01-03. You can specify a published_after value to reduce this time frame if necessary (e.g. published_after=2021-01-08).

sentiment_lte	false	Use this to refine results to find all documents for entities with a sentiment_score less than or equal to x.
Example: sentiment_lte=0 - this will find all document entities which are neutral or negative

+ signifies AND operation
| signifies OR operation
- negates a single token
" wraps a number of tokens to signify a phrase for searching
* at the end of a term signifies a prefix query
( and ) signify precedence
To use one of these characters literally, escape it with a preceding backslash (\).
