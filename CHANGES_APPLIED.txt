OVERFITTING FIXES APPLIED - Ready for Testing
================================================

✅ LSTM Model Optimizations (src/models/lstm_model.py):
- Reduced hidden_size: 128 → 64 (50% reduction, ~75% fewer parameters)
- Increased dropout: 0.3 → 0.5 (stronger regularization)
- Reduced learning_rate: 0.001 → 0.0003 (slower, more stable learning)
- Increased batch_size: 64 → 128 (more stable gradients)
- Reduced early_stopping_patience: 10 → 5 (stop overfitting sooner)
- Increased weight_decay: 1e-4 → 1e-3 (10x stronger L2 regularization)
- Added gradient clipping: max_norm=1.0 (prevents exploding gradients)
- Added label smoothing: 0.1 (prevents overconfident predictions)
- Added learning rate scheduler: ReduceLROnPlateau (adaptive learning)
- Improved early stopping: monitors both val_loss AND val_acc

✅ Cross-Validation Fix (src/models/hybrid_ensemble.py):
- Changed StratifiedKFold → TimeSeriesSplit
- CRITICAL: Respects temporal ordering, prevents data leakage
- Aligns with Walk-Forward Validation spec

✅ Training Speed Optimizations (src/config.py):
- Reduced Optuna trials: 8 → 5 (saves ~2 hours)
- Kept cv_folds: 3 (already optimized)

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Training time: ~4 hours → ~2 hours (50% faster)
- Train-Val accuracy gap: 12% → 5-7% (less overfitting)
- Validation accuracy: +3-5% improvement
- More stable, generalizable model

NEXT STEPS:
1. Run training on Kaggle
2. Monitor train/val accuracy gap
3. Check if early stopping triggers around epoch 15-20 (vs 20-25 before)
4. Verify training completes in ~2 hours instead of 4+
